# Maps

+ ### Collections of value types that are accessed through keys

+ ### Created using **literals** or through **`make()`** function

+ ### Members are accessed through **`[key]`** syntax

  + ### `map_name["key"] = "value"`

+ ### Check for presence of element with `"value, ok"` form of result

+ ### Multiple assignments refer to same underlying data


## Structs

+ ### Collections of disparate data types that describe a single concept

+ ### Keyed by named fields

+ ### Normally created as types, but anonymous structs are allowed

+ ### Structs are value types

+ ### No inheritance, but can use **composition** through **embedding**

+ ### Tags can be added to struct fields to describe field
